                Introduction
              </h1>
              <p class="head" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                In the present era when startup is a popular option, many youngsters are confused if to start a startup
                or go for a job. So, this is the most common question among youngsters that which to choose “Startup or
                Job”?
                When taking work environments into consideration, one must understand that startups are initiated with
                very specific people on board. These people generally are skilled professionals from different fields
                who have been chosen to take the company further. When talking about massive companies and
                conglomerates, these companies present the opportunity to work in that specific field extensively.
                Larger companies isolate their departments and thus there is very minimal interaction with people from
                other departments.
                Stability is one aspect where jobs definitely take the cake. Jobs are known for being stable and
                long-lasting as these processes, products, services and companies are there for a long time. MNCs such
                as Amazon, Google or Microsoft offer the stability which is unbeatable as long as the employee performs.
                But this is not the case with newer companies or startups as sometimes they require the coordination and
                cooperation of the various departments to meet deployment or delivery deadlines.
                When comparing jobs Vs startups both are observed to have their unique advantages and disadvantages.
                Both career options are providing incredible salaries nowadays, so one must wonder about what is more
                important to him or her personally, when given an opportunity to choose among a new startup or an MNC,
                which has been around for decades.

                    <b>Recognition of Jobs</b> : Employee recognition is the acknowledgment of a company’s staff for
                    exemplary performance. Essentially, the goal of employee recognition in the workplace is to
                    reinforce particular behaviors, practices, or activities that result in better performance and
                    positive business results.
                    <br>

                    1. <b>Informal Recognition</b> : Informal recognition can occur sporadically and provides constant
                    reassurance of the value and efforts that an employee offers. Informal recognition includes
                    small and unplanned notes, messages, declarations or gifts for employees who exceed
                    expectations or work on extra projects.
                    <br>


                    2. <b>Formal Recognition</b> : Formal recognition occurs in many forms and typically follows a
                    schedule or set structure. Awards, such as an employee of the month, an employee of the year
                    and work anniversaries, are formal forms of recognition. Knowing the structure and routine of
                    these awards keeps employees interested in striving to earn these types of recognition.
                    <br>

                    3. <b>Monetary Recognition</b> :monetary recognition show an employee the value placed on their
                    work. Giving small bonuses when an employee achieves a goal or shows a high level of
                    performance can help create an environment of spontaneous praise and motivation.
                    <br>


                    4. <b>Social Recognition</b> : ( peer to peer ) :Peer-to-peer recognition is when employees on the
                    same
                    level or in the same department offer praise to each other. A peer may publicly or privately
                    praise a coworker for their work, help or general attitude. Knowing that your peers recognize
                    your actions and attitudes motivates you to maintain and improve how you work with others.
                    <br>

                    ( Leader To Team Member) : When a leader recognizes and praises the work of a team member,
                    they create a positive environment and encourage their team to recognize each other's work and
                    impact. Receiving praise and positive confirmations from a leader promotes an employee's
                    desire to continue their work and to strive for even greater achievements
                    <br>

                  <h4><b>Recognition of start-up</b></h4>
                  <p>How to get a start up recognised : </p>
                  <br>
                  1. Department for promotion of industry and internal trade ( DPIIT ) : The DPIIT Certificate of
                  Recognition for Startups will be issued after examination of the application and documents
                  submitted.
                  <br>
                  Once the ministry approves the application and provides the unique startup recognition
                  number, the startup can be registered with tax benefits.
                  <br>

                  2. Tax Exemption certificate :Post getting recognition a Startup may apply for Tax exemption
                  under section 80 IAC of the Income Tax Act. Post getting clearance for Tax exemption, the
                  Startup can avail tax holiday for 3 consecutive financial years out of its first ten years since
                  incorporation.
                  <br>

                  Benefits of getting recognised :
                  <br>
                  1. Relaxed norms/standard : All the startups that get recognised by DPIIT can get listed as
                  sellers on Government e-Marketplace, which is the Government of India’s largest eprocurement portal.
                  <br>
                  2. Access to funding : your company can raise money from the Fund of Fund For Startups
                  (FFS) that has a corpus of whooping Rs 10,000 crore.
                  <br>
                  Another fund of funds under Startup India is for companies looking for seed round of
                  investment. Formally known as Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS).
                  <br>
                  3. Easy exit : if your startup is recognised by DPIIT and you need to take an exit, it’s quite a
                  simple process. A startup can shut down their business within 90 days from the date of
                  application.

                    Work Culture / Vision
                  </h1>
                  <p class="head" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                    Work culture is a consequence in an organization formed by a set of values and beliefs, carried
                    forward
                    from long time and has substantial impact in the behavior, quality, and quantity of work done by the
                    employee in an organization. A decade ago, the corporate culture in India had a vast difference as
                    compared to rest of the world, especially western countries. But, now there is a paradigm shift due
                    to
                    enormous growth of MNC's in IT sector India, BPO's etc.
                    <br>
                    The advent of globalization made business enterprises and employees to work across the borders of
                    various countries, thus providing exposure to cross cultural working environment to both the
                    organizations and employees. This eliminated the huge gap between the work culture of India and
                    other
                    countries to some extent. However, in fields other than IT and Government sectors of India the work
                    culture differs a lot from that of other countries.
                    <br>
                    In India, it is an accepted habit to work for 10 hours; in the US, it is an exception to the rule,'
                    In
                    all the Western countries, especially USA, people strictly adhere to the time. They work in the
                    office
                    for eight hours a day. They generally complete their assigned work with in the deadlines; in absence
                    of
                    which they keep it informed ahead of time to their boss.
                    <br>
                    They attend the meetings sharply in scheduled timings and the meeting agenda is given at least a
                    week
                    before in most of the cases. They take lunch break for half an hour. Employees try to be more
                    productive
                    and they work with full commitment, without any other deviations during the eight hours they
                    work.They
                    work for only five-day week, never work on weekends. On the contrary, in India, people do not adhere
                    to
                    the timings. No doubt, they work for long hours approximately for 10-12hrs a day and sometimes even
                    on
                    weekends, but take long tea breaks and lunch breaks.
                    <br>
                    They are not very imperative on deadlines and keep negotiating for extension of timeline. Some times
                    scheduled meetings are canceled, due to absence of some key persons. However, the number of hours
                    put on
                    does not matter; it is only the output and accomplishment of work that matters in all types of work.
                    <br>
                    More major difference is the work-life balance. In Western work-culture, they give more value to the
                    time spent for their personal life. They do not carry the workplace pressures or stress to home.
                    Eventually work is a part of their life, but not the life itself. Nevertheless, they stay back at
                    office
                    occasionally, when they need to work. Most of the Indians think workplace as an opportunity to build
                    their future and put forth extensive efforts to climb the corporate ladder and earn monetary
                    benefits.
                    They work day and night beyond limits, which results in losing work- life balance.This also makes
                    them
                    encounter a lot of pressure.
                    <br>
                    The relationship between the boss and subordinates is believed to be more formal and hierarchical in
                    India. People in power openly display their ranks according to which importance is given. Employees
                    are
                    not supposed to expect clear guidance from the managers and they are often not assigned with
                    important
                    work. Subordinates are expected to take the blame for things that go wrong. The relationship between
                    boss and subordinate is rarely close/personal. In general company meetings only few people dominate,
                    even though their decisions are wrong. However, it may vary from company to company. Whereas in
                    western
                    work culture the relation between boss and subordinate is not more formal and hierarchical,
                    superiors
                    treat subordinates with respect and do not demonstrate ranks. Subordinates are entrusted with
                    important
                    assignments. Blame for things that go wrong is either shared or is often accepted by the superior,
                    due
                    to it being their responsibility to manage.Managers often socialize with subordinates. Meetings are
                    interactive sessions to arrive at best decisions.

                    first stages of operations. Startups are founded by one or more entrepreneurs who want to develop a
                    product or service for which they believe there is demand. These companies generally start with high
                    costs and limited revenue, which is why they look for capital from a variety of sources such as
                    venture capitalists.

                  <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">Key Takeaways</h2>
                  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200"></p> A startup is a company that's in the initial stages of
                  business.
                  Founders normally finance their startups and may attempt to attract outside investment before they
                  get off the ground.
                  <br>
                  Funding sources include family and friends, venture capitalists, crowdfunding, and loans.
                  <br>
                  Startups must also consider where they'll do business and their legal structure.
                  <br>
                  Startups come with high risk as failure is very possible but they can also be very unique places to
                  work with great benefits, a focus on innovation, and great opportunities to learn.</p>

                  <p class="head" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">A vision statement is what drives you and your
                    employees to push and succeed. It is the
                    reason your startup exists. Thus, when you as a startup owner have a strong vision, you can easily
                    motivate your employees to perform at their maximum potential.
                    Clearly defined vision and mission statements also allow customers, suppliers and shareholders to
                    decide
                    whether or not they wish to be associated with your startup. It is a mirror for all to observe the
                    clarity of purpose and value of a company to all outsiders.
                    It is important to understand that a mission and vision statement are not the same. A vision
                    statement
                    describes a company’s goals for the futureYour vision (what you aim to achieve) is very
                    straightforward
                    and clarifies your business goals. Your vision must be precise in detail, measurable, attainable,
                    and
                    single-minded. To be practical in the age of clutter and noise, your strategic vision needs to focus
                    on
                    achieving both near term (one year out) and long-term business goals (3-5 years out).


                    Guidance for developing your vision statement:
                    Measurable – so your organization will know progress is being made.

                    Attainable – it must stretch your current capabilities but not be lofty “pie in the sky”.

                    Inspiring – must engage your people emotionally.

                    Cultural – must fit within your organizations unique “way of being”.

                    Single-minded – must be specific and detailed.

                    Vivid – must be clear and understood by all.</p>

                    • Whenever people get an idea, they think they can go to a startup for the same thing, but that’s
                    not
                    the case. There is a myth that starting up is a guarantee of floating in cash and lavish lifestyles,
                    like the posts of founder Lucas Duplan with his cash loads and extravagances.
                    <br>
                    • Being your own boss and working long weekends for no extra pay, cutting corners at every stage of
                    the
                    business, and reinvesting money earned back into the business are just a few of the things you will
                    have
                    to go through if you want to start one. which automatically means there isn’t really a lot of money
                    floating around in the first place for you to take home a hefty pay check.
                    <br>
                    The point is that since they don't possess entrepreneurial traits, they may be doing more harm than
                    good, even if they're not aware of their actions.
                    <br>
                    •Even if a person is aware of all the difficulties and challenges, many of them fail due to the
                    unique
                    selling point, or differentiating factor.
                    <br>
                    • While it is perfectly possible to build something better on an existing idea, it must not merely
                    be an
                    extension of the original idea.
                    <br>
                    Currently, other than the exceptions, most of the Indian startups are copies of their US
                    counterparts.
                    Some startups are created solely to compete in the entrepreneurship race, even if the idea is not
                    even
                    feasible for society or the people.
                    <br>
                    •Example a startup making highly advanced electric locks costing around 15k for the Indian market is
                    not
                    feasible.
                    <br>
                    •Many ideas even don’t cope with the Indian societal framework as they are just copies and cant be
                    scaled further with the masses and thus shut down.
                    <br>
                    •Many of them claim to solve a problem, but it is a problem that isn’t that important or for the
                    masses;
                    rather, they are selecting a very niche market.
                    <br>
                    So if you are thinking of doing a startup just because of the active culture, you better hold on to
                    that
                    old, safe, boring 9-to-5 job.

                    Product Diversity
                  </h1>
                  <h4>DEFINITION</h4>
                  <p class="head" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                    Product diversification is the practice of expanding the original market for a product.
                    <br><br>
                    This strategy is used to increase the sales associated with an existing product line , which is
                    especially useful for a business that has been experiencing stagnant or declining sales.
                    eg :- TATA Group initially ventured into the steel manufacturing business and diversified it into
                    other
                    segments such as hospitality , aviation, automobile , power.
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <h4>WHAT IS A PRODUCT LINE?
                  </h4>
                  <p class="head" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                    A Product line is a cluster of products that are marketed under the same brand umbrella , all sold
                    by
                    the same company. <br>
                    A larger business may group its products into a set of product lines , each supported by a different
                    marketing team. <br>
                    Companies may create product lines within certain markets and then rebrand them in other markets to
                    suit local tastes. <br>
                    eg:- Maruti Suzuki had launched Alto in the year 2000 which was a product between two other models
                    of
                    Maruti-Maruti 800 and Maruti Zen. <br>
                  </p>
                  <h5>Advantages of Product Line?
                  </h5>
                  <p class="head" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                    It is Cost-effective.
                    <br>
                    It is generally safer to add a product to an existing product line than to create a free standing
                    product.
                    <br>
                    Since customers tend to buy repeatedly within the same brand, and so would favour a product within a
                    product line over a free standing product.
                    <br>

                  <h5>PRODUCTION DIVERSIFICATION TECHNIQUES</h5>
                  <p class="head" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                    There are number of ways to engage in product diversification: <br><br>
                    (i) REPACKAGING <br>
                    The manner in which a product is presented can be altered to make it available to a different
                    audience. <br>
                    eg:- a) A household cleaning product could be repackaged and sold as a cleaning agent for
                    automobiles.
                    <br>
                    b) Apple's packaging of the iPhone 12 also uses more wood fibre(or paper pulp) than the packaging
                    for
                    previous models , including the replacement of the plastic display protector with ones made from
                    fibre.
                    <br><br>


                    (ii) RENAMING <br>
                    An existing product could be renamed , perhaps along with somewhat different packaging , and sold in
                    a different country. <br>
                    The intent is to remain true to the original purpose of the product , but to adjust it to match the
                    local culture. <br>
                    eg:- Notable renaming : <br>
                    Old Name, New Name,
                    Apple computer, Apple,
                    Backrub, Google,
                    Brad’s Drink, Pepsi, Cola etc.
                    <br><br>

                    (iii) RESIZING <br>
                    A product could be repackaged into a different size or standard selling quantity. <br>
                    eg:- A product normally sold as a single unit could be packaged into a quantity of ten and then sold
                    through a warehouse store. <br><br>

                    (iv) REPRICING <br>
                    The price of a product can be adjusted , along with other improvements , to reposition it for sale
                    through a new distribution channel. <br>
                    eg:- A watch movement could be inserted into a platinum casing and sold through jewellery stores ,
                    rather than its original positioning as a sport watch. <br><br>

                    (v) BRAND EXTENSION <br>
                    Brand extension is a marketing strategy that involves a company using its well-established brand
                    name
                    or image to introduce a new product or product categories to its customer base. <br>
                    This strategy works best when the new product category is related to its parent category and is
                    something consumers and customers wants. <br><br>

                  <h5 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">Advantages of Product Diversification </h5>
                  Product diversification helps in maximizing the utilization of available resources. <br>
                  It helps in multiple investments , which helps absorb losses incurred by any other investment. <br>
                  Many economic factors lead to the falling of certain industries for a specific time frame. <br>
                  Diversification helps in providing movement away from such activities that create decline. <br>
                  Diversification into various industries or product lines helps create stability for the company during
                  economic changing scenarios. <br>
                  <br>
                  </p>
                  <h5 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">CONCLUSION</h5><br>
                  <p class="head" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                    Diversification strategies help companies expand their operations in to different business markets.
                    Companies also adopt diversification strategy to reduce the risk by moving in to several business
                    areas.
                    Concentric diversification occurs when a company adds related products or markets.

                    Technology has revolutionized different industries and services worldwide. Although it has helped
                    many people in everyday life, not all have benefited from it. Many people work in jobs that require
                    them to use technology, but not all are experts in using it. Startups provide a way for people who
                    understand the power of technology to earn a good income.
                    <br>
                    Jobs and startups differ in their number of workers and employees globally. For example, India has
                    150 million working age adults- more than the total number of working age adults in Australia and
                    the US. In contrast, Sweden has only 80,000 working age adults compared to 1.2 million in India.
                    According to experts, this is partially due to India's lower average educational levels compared to
                    other countries. For example, India has lower education levels with 70% of its population having an
                    educational level of secondary school completion or higher. In general, the number of jobs versus
                    startups varies from country to country.
                    <br>
                    Startups are characterized by new technology and innovations. For example, Facebook revolutionized
                    social media with its innovative tools, design and features. This led to the creation of many new
                    jobs for young adults willing to take a risk and learn new technology. These jobs provide an avenue
                    for young adults to get experience and training necessary for successful careers. However, not all
                    young adults understand how to use technology for business-related purposes. Therefore, not all have
                    the ability to start a business or job via a startup.
                    <br>
                    To grow a business, you must have a strong base of customers and investors. Many startups take
                    advantage of new technologies to create unique products for customers- similar to how Apple creates
                    products for consumers with tech degrees. This leads to long-term profits as well as new job
                    opportunities for investors willing to support new businesses through startup investments. Creating
                    viable customers requires investment in advertising or direct interactions with potential consumers
                    via social media.
                    <br>
                    Technology has changed many industries worldwide- but not everyone understands how to apply it
                    effectively. Jobs and startups allow people who understand technology to earn a good living wage.
                    Furthermore, startups help people innovate and create profitable businesses based on existing
                    technology know-how.

                    Zomato is an Indian group founded by two IIT graduates, Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah, in Delhi
                    NCR
                    in 2008.
                    Once Deepinder saw his colleagues ordering food from different restaurants. That was when Deepinder
                    came
                    up with bringing these restaurant menus online.
                    One day they noticed their colleagues standing in a long queue in the cafeteria waiting for lunch.
                    So they thought about how much time people could save if they did not have to wait and get their
                    favorite food delivered to their doorstep whenever required.
                    It is how they started the online food delivery service under “FoodieBay” and renamed it “Zomato.”
                    In
                    the initial stage, FoodieBay listed restaurants in Delhi and NCR. But, they grew their business very
                    soon in other metro cities like Kolkata and Mumbai.
                    As FoodieBay started attracting more and more customers, the founders decided to revamp its name to
                    appeal to audiences outside India too. So then they changed the name of FoodieBay to “Zomato.” By
                    2016,
                    Zomato had its sophisticated app doing food deliveries from registered restaurants.

                    Zomato is active on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. It has 757K followers, 1.5 million followers
                    on
                    Twitter, and more than 737K followers on LinkedIn. <br>
                    Zomato communicates with its customers by creating posts on popular subjects.
                    The brand is aware of its audiences, likes, and dislikes. As a result, it supports material that
                    people
                    love to share, discuss, and reconsider. <br>
                    To engage customers online, it utilizes popular topics and publishes simple pictures.
                    During the 2016 Olympics, Zomato promoted its brand on Twitter. The brand used Olympic rings made of
                    coffee and claimed they would receive the gold medal if drinking coffee were a sport.
                    Another hot subject that Zomato targeted was The “Pokemon Go” video game. Zomato started earning
                    from
                    that too. The brand used the famous Pikachu to promote its brand on Twitter. <br>
                    Connecting with the customers by Zomato was aided by positing popular themes. Users possibly don’t
                    want
                    to contemplate too much while using social media. Individuals use social media to enjoy and view
                    humorous content.

                    Business Model
                  </h3>
                  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                    The success of Zomato lies in its unique Business Model. Zomato is an app whose business model works
                    around the supply of food online, providing knowledge, user reviews, and menus of partner
                    restaurants.
                    Here are some of the essential components of Zomato’s business model: <br>
                    1. Customer segments- The customer segment of Zomato has three different components: Local
                    restaurants,
                    reviews, and users. <br>
                    2. Zomato provisions- Zomato has created a well-designed valuation model for its food delivery
                    services.
                    Zomato Gold & Piggybank has enhanced the standard of services that Zomato offers. <br>
                    3. Alliances of Zomato- New partnerships with several big names like Visa, Uber Taxi, and Paypal
                    have
                    improved the business model of Zomato. <br>
                    This online food delivery app provides a discount to advertise its usage and improve its customer
                    base,
                    considering the tough competition in the market. It’s mainly a selling strategy. Zomato soon started
                    its
                    service in the Cloud Kitchen industry too. <br>
